# Task-of-test-in-python
A powerful, fully automated Product Listing (PL) and Product Detail Page (PDP) scraper built using Python, MongoDB, requests, and json parsing.  This project extracts thousands of product URLs directly from the SunglassHut website, then fetches complete product details using the site’s hidden PDP JSON API.
